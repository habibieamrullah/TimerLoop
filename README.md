# TimerLoop
Simple JavaScript application to set alert and timer repeatedly

Timer Loop is a simple tool to make you remember something that you must do it every each x time interval. Everytime that x time comes, an alert sound will be played.

Set the time interval in minutes (for example, if you want 2 minutes type 2) then click start. Then, each that time interval you will hear the alert sound reminding you until you stop it.
